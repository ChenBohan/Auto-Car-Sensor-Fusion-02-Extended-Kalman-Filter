# Auto-Car-Sensor-Fusion-02-Lidar-and-Radar-Fusion
Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree:  Lidar and Radar Fusion with Kalman Filters in C++.
The task is to track a prdestrain moving in front of our autonomous vehicle.

## Overview of the Kalman Filter Algorithm Map
The Kalman Filter algorithm will go through the following steps:
- First measurement.
- initialize state and covariance matrices.
- Predict.
- Update.
- Do another predict and update step (when receive another sensor measurement).

## Two-step estimation problem
